/*
Lexicographical Order - also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders
characters as:
A < B < ... < Y < Z < a < b ... < y < z

e.g. ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoom < ball.

A substring of a string is a contiguous block of chars in the string.

e.g. substrings of 'abc' - 'a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'bc', 'abc'

Given string, s, and an integer, k, complete the function so that it
finds the lexicographically smallest and longest substrings of length k.
